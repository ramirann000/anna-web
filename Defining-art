How would you define art? 
I would define art as a personal expression, that portrays a persons interests, their creativeness, their way of thinking and their artistic skills. For me I think anything could be art, wether it is something small or realy big. Or something only you understand, or something that everyoned gets.
It could be art that you do on paper, or a canvas, or even in a computer. I think photography could be an art, dancing is an art, singing.
I believe that art isn't just what we are taught in school, it isn't just using pencils or colors to draw something on paper. Many other people can interpret it in different ways.
